            <p class="double"> You may have heard of something called archaeology. Archaeology is the study of human history and prehistory by excavating, or digging up, sites with artifacts that are then analyzed. However, archaeology is more than just that.</p>

            <p class="double"> For starters, think about how someone hundreds of years ago would think of your phone. What would they think, simply looking at the black screen and rectangle shape? A thousand years later, what clues left behind from your phone would tell your story, your life?
                This is what archaeologists aim to figure out, except instead of someone else in the future looking at your items, they're the ones looking at people from the past's items to put together that particular person's story and life.
            </p>

        <h2>What makes archaeology fun? Is it even fun?</h2>

        <p class="double">You most likely thought archaeology was boring. After all, from the surface it seems to just be searching for artifacts and analyzing them. Studying the past, however, isn’t dull at all.
Archaeology is full of mystery. Although a lot of the things archaeologists have found have been explained, the process to explain it is full of guessing and a constant search for evidence. Many artifacts or ancient buildings have never been explained or solved. Archaeologists never know from day to day what kind of things they’ll find—it’s all one big, random adventure, full of surprises.
Digging in the dirt all day might not appeal to some and might appeal to others—the thing is, you don’t need to be hands on. Putting together broken artifacts or looking at 3D models of sites is just as helpful and just as interesting.
If you’re a travel person or love to see new places, archaeology is perfect for you.   Many archaeological jobs and careers let you travel to faraway sites all around the world. 
Archaeologists, through exploring the past, can also solve issues in today’s world through learning how ancient civilizations used to operate. All in all, archaeology is fun because of all the possibilities and exploration of the past.</p>
        
        <h2>Well...why does it matter?</h2>
        
        <p class="double">Archaeology’s objective is to understand how and why humans changed over time. Although archaeology seems like just another one of those boring jobs that requires too much work, archaeology is actually incredibly important. What people from long ago leave behind physically because not everything is written down (if there even was language at the time). Archaeology can also explain many mysteries from the past, like how monuments and artifacts came into existence.</p>


        <h2>What can I do to be a part of archaeology?</h2>
        
        <p class="double">Although archaeology is a job that requires a lot of knowledge, anyone can be a part of it. You don't have to dig anything up—you can help identify things online or visit a local dig site that's open to volunteers. If you're a younger person, you can read books, watch documentaries, or visit museum exhibits about ancient cultures and archaeology. The more you learn, the better you can understand why artifacts and other facts are so significant. Sometimes, things can be found in your own yard! If you have permission, you can dig around in some soil to see what you find.</p>

        <h2>What does archaeology really do?</h2>

        <p class="double">Archaeology shows us how people from ancient times built monuments, survived droughts, and handled crises. It's not just finding artifacts and taking guesses. Most of the time, artifacts and other clues won't be well preserved, if at all. Weather wears away at any items, tearing holes in the metaphorical picture archaeologists want to see. It's like a mystery with many missing chunks. Archaeologists are detectives of the past! By studying the world around us, we can learn more about ourselves and how humans changed over the years.</p>
