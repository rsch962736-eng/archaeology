            <p>You may have heard of something called archaeology. Archaeology is the study of human history and prehistory by excavating, or digging up, sites with artifacts that are then analyzed. However, archaeology is more than just that.</p>
            
            <p>For starters, think about how someone hundreds of years ago would think of your phone. What would they think, simply looking at the black screen and rectangle shape? A thousand years later, what clues left behind from your phone would tell your story, your life?</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>What does archaeology really do?</h2>
        
        <p>Archaeology shows us how people from ancient times built monuments, survived droughts, and handled crises. It's not just finding artifacts and taking guesses, however.</p>
        
        <p>Most of the time, artifacts and other clues won't be well preserved, if at all. Weather wears away at any items, tearing holes in the metaphorical picture archaeologists want to see. It's like a mystery with many missing chunks. Archaeologists are detectives of the past!</p>
        
        <h2>What can I do to be a part of archaeology?</h2>
        
        <p>Although archaeology is a job that requires a lot of knowledge, anyone can be a part of it. You don't have to dig anything up—you can help identify things online or visit a local dig site that's open to volunteers.</p>
